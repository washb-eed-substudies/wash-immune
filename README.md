### WASH Benefits Bangladesh Effects of Interventions on Child Immune Status

This is the repository for the WASH Benefits Bangladesh [NCT01590095](#https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01590095) intervention effects on immune status substudy. The primary analysis assessed the impacts of nutrition and WSH interventions on levels of individual cytokines and cytokine ratios. This repository contains scripts for both the primary analyses as well as for generating tables and figures.

### Associated protocols and datasets
The pre-specified analysis plan and the data required for the analysis will be available through the Open Science Framework: [https://osf.io/p9c6q/](https://osf.io/p9c6q/).

### WASH Benefits Package
This analysis requires [washb](https://github.com/ben-arnold/washb), a package developed for WASH Benefits analyses. 

For all scripts, you will need to change directory statements to reflect locations of files within your local directory. Changes will also need to be made to directory statements when saving output files such as results, tables, and figures.
